This repo is for the submission of the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course of the Data Science Specialization.

I cleaned the data in the 5 steps as detailed both below and in the run_analysis.R project itself, and also uploaded a code book and a tidy data .txt file.

The requirements are as follows:

Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
